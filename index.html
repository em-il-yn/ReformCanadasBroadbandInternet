                <p>Currently <span class="highlight">85.7 percent of Canadians have access to broadband internet.</span> This issue isn’t who has broadband internet, <span class="highlight">the issue is who doesn’t have broadband internet and why.</span></p>  
                <p>Most urban areas such as larger cities have 100% broadband coverage, whereas rural areas of Canada only have 40.5% coverage.</p>
                <p>This data is provided to the CRTC by Internet Service Providers, the companies the CRTC is mandated to regulate.

                <h3 id="1.2">Why is Broadband internet important?</h3>
                <p>The question of why broadband internet is important seems like one that should be obvious. We use the internet in so many facets of our life now, that not having access can put individuals at a severe disadvantage. Especially now, when we preach long distance connectivity with others. The internet helps provide people in rural areas with limited access to healthcare professionals with vital <span class="highlight">medical information</span>. It connects people with <span class="highlight">job opportunities, and learning opportunities.</span> Having an adequate upload speed allows people to utilize their skills as creators. Reliable internet also helps <span class="highlight">small businesses connect to the digital economy.</span></p>
                <p>In light of the current global pandemic public schools are suddenly closed and require the internet to learn (source global). <span class="highlight">School needs to be a right for all Canadians so it only follows that if students are required to study from home the internet should be a right.</span></p>
                <p>If you think that not having broadband simply means having to wait a little longer for a youtube video to load, that is not the case. Minimum speeds are required for functions like conference calls, and video chats among other things <span>“Andrew Negus said his clients, architectural firms in Toronto, send large files through email to his company and slow internet speeds hurt their ability to do business. "We spend half a day to downloading them on our end," he said. "Some of these are very time sensitive quote opportunities. We have a day or two to get a price in ... it puts us at a disadvantage."”</span><a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ont-rural-broadband-1.5278660" class="source inline">(The Canadian Press, 2019)</a></p>

                <h2 id="2">What are the main barriers to having broadband internet?</h2>
                <p>Internet service providers are private companies with the sole goal of profitability. While the cost of providing internet is relatively cheap, the necessary infrastructure to provide internet is extremely expensive. Because the population in rural areas of Canada is sparse, extending the fibre cables necessary for broadband internet into these areas is extremely costly. The profit driven privatized internet system in Canada results in how most urban areas such as larger cities have 100% broadband coverage, whereas <span class="highlight">rural areas of Canada only have 40.8% coverage</span> <a target="_blank" href="https://crtc.gc.ca/eng/internet/internet.htm" class="source inline">(CRTC, 2020).</a></p>
                <p>In addition to having less access to the internet in rural areas of Canada, the cost of internet is higher as well. Rural areas of Canada have much higher internet costs due to less options for choosing Internet Service Providers. According to the CRTC <span>“<span class="highlight">There are between three and nine competing ISPs in the majority of urban centres,</span> and between two and six wireless service providers (WSPs), thereby ensuring that Canadians living in urban centres enjoy the benefits of competitive offerings in the retail broadband Internet access services market. However, competitive and technological challenges related to the provision of fixed and mobile wireless broadband Internet access services in rural and remote areas can lead to higher prices for consumers.”</span><a target="_blank" href="https://crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2016/2016-496.htm" class="source inline">(CRTC, 2016).</a> In this same document there is no acknowledgement of ISPs in rural areas of Canada, and the options for these areas. <span class="highlight">Rural areas of Canada face higher internet rates than cities despite experiencing worse service.</span></p>
                <p><span class="quote">“For Tomeko Martin, a Toronto single mother of a nine-year-old boy, internet access is essential but expensive. <span class="highlight">Martin, who is visually impaired, pays about $170 a month to Bell Canada for a bundled package of services that includes internet access. She receives a cheque from Ontario Disability Support Program (ODSP) for $1,049 a month.</span> "I don't think it's fair that they make millions and billions of dollars a year but they can't afford to offer low-cost internet to low-income families. The point is, there are people out there who need lower-cost internet. The internet, let's face it, is becoming a huge part of everybody's lives. Pretty soon, everything is going to be online."”</span><a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/barriers-to-digital-equity-acorn-canada-report-low-income-families-1.5244339" class="source">(Draaisma, 2019)</a></p>
                <p><span>Globally Canada is currently 69th in the world for the most affordable internet with many other countries being able to provide much more affordable adequate internet.</span> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cable.co.uk/broadband/pricing/worldwide-comparison/#regions"  class="source inline">(Cable, 2020).</a></p>

                <h3 id="2.1">What is being done?</h3>
                <p><span>In December of 2016 the CRTC released the “Telecom Regulatory Policy CRTC 2016-496” in pursuit of addressing the gaps in coverage and service to rural areas of Canada </span><a target="_blank" href="https://crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2016/2016-496.htm" class="source inline">(CRTC, 2016).</a> To establish this policy the CRTC had public proceedings to allow for the voices of many different parties to be heard including ISPs, non-profit organizations advocating for low income citizens, as well as citizens themselves. This established <span class="highlight">the Broadband Fund, a fund for which applicants can apply to receive funding to install the necessary fibre cables for bringing high speed internet to Canadians in rural areas.</span> The government and major ISPs will contribute annually to a fund that would begin at $100 million and then increase by 25 million each year to reach $200 million dollars by year 5. These funds would then be distributed to applicants who best meet the criteria for funding. The applicants must show sufficient ability and experience to install the necessary cables, and must contribute a certain amount of money to qualify. Additionally the applicant must be applying for an area of Canada where what the CRTC deems the needs for Broadband internet are not already met.</p>
            </article>
            <article  id="2.2">
                <h3>Issues with The Broadband Fund</h3>
                <p>The Broadband Fund is the only mechanism the CRTC have to address the gaps in broadband internet coverage in Canada. There are many flaws with this fund. </p>
                <p><span class="highlight">Communities which rely on Satellite coverage are exempt from receiving funding despite being slow, unreliable, and expensive.</span> <span>“The main component of the Broadband Fund will provide funding for projects in all areas except in satellite-dependent communities and covers all broadband technologies, including direct-to-home (DTH) satellites.”</span> <a target="_blank" href="https://crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2018/2018-241.htm"  class="source inline">(CRTC, 2018).</a> This is an issue because if you look at Xplorenet, a common provider of satellite service to rural areas of Canada, the cheapest internet plan offered is $99.99 per month, which is an unaffordable lowest rate.</p>
                <p>To address the lack of coverage in Indigenous communities there needs to be a structured plan. Within the Broadband Fund, there is no mechanism to ensure that indigenous communities are addressed as the applicants apply for whichever areas they choose. <span class="highlight">There is no mechanism in the policy which specifically addresses the lack of broadband internet in Indigenous communities.</span> Denise Williams, CEO of the First Nations Technology Council says of the solutions to lack of coverage <span>“she appreciates the funding opportunities, but <span class="highlight">a framework is essential to ensure not only that every First Nations home, school and business has broadband access, but that First Nations have the ability to use that access to further their own self-governance and sovereignty goals.</span>”</span> <a target="_blank" href="https://thetyee.ca/News/2019/12/12/Closing-BC-Indigenous-Internet-Gap/" class="source inline">(Hyslop, 2019)</a> A framework must be put in place which works with Indigenous communities to include them in the establishment of internet infrastructure, and not simply as an afterthought. </p>
                <p>In addition to this, the way in which areas are deemed in need of funding is by using 25km hexagons. <span>“If one household within a hexagon is deemed to be served, it is likely that market forces will bring improved levels of broadband Internet access service to the remaining households in the hexagon. The Commission therefore considers that all households in a hexagon must be underserved for that hexagon to be deemed underserved and thus eligible for funding.”</span> <a target="_blank" href="https://crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2018/2018-241.htm" class="source inline">(CRTC, 2018).</a> This can be limiting because one household in a 25 km section having adequate internet speeds does not guarantee adequate internet speeds. In addition to this, the policy has been put in place with no option to contest eligible areas for funding.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h3  id="2.3">The Market Will Not Balance Everything Out</h3>
                <p>Three companies in Canada dominate the market as Internet Service Providers. <span class="quote">“Bell, Rogers, Telus, and the other large incumbents still account for 87 per cent of residential internet subscriptions in Canada.”</span> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/internet-services-rates-canada-1.4596554" class="source">(Saltzman, 2018).</a> The A system which is profit driven will never serve those who are not profitable. Therefore, relying on applicants to choose the areas in which they want to provide broadband internet coverage will not adequately address the needs of Canadians.</p>
                <p>In the proceedings in 2016 surrounding the establishment of the current Broadband Fund plan, Bell advocated for limited intervention on the part of the CRTC. <span class="quote">“Some parties, such as Bell Canada et al. and Eastlink, submitted that any Commission intervention to support the expansion of broadband Internet access service availability should be a last resort, and should be considered only for the most remote areas not reached by market forces or government funding.”</span> <a target="_blank" href="https://crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2016/2016-496.htm" class="source">(CRTC, 2016)</a></p>
                <p>Whereas other parties present, advocated for more support for rural communities: <span class="quote">“Many parties, including the AAC, the Eastern Ontario Regional Network / Eastern Ontario Wardens’ Caucus (EORN/EOWC), the JTF, MKO, and OpenMedia, submitted that the Commission needs to take action in addressing the broadband Internet access service availability gap. These parties argued that market forces and targeted government funding will not result in the universal availability of broadband Internet access services. MKO submitted that the Commission attempted a “soft strategy” in 2011, and that since then, the connectivity gap has increased. The First Mile Connectivity Consortium (FMCC) and the JTF submitted that while federal funding programs have provided benefits for many underserved communities, they are not sufficient in scope, scale, or sustainability to fully address the gaps. These parties argued that the Commission should therefore take action.”</span> <a target="_blank" href="https://crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2016/2016-496.htm" class="source">(CRTC, 2016)</a> </p>
                <p>Canada was not improved by large companies and the market, but rather by government funding and the measures put in place by the CRTC. All solutions came from public funding and not from a system that prioritizes profit.</p>
                <p>Additionally, the oligopoly of Shaw, Rogers, and Bell in Canada results in higher prices for all Canadians. In 2015, it was mandated that larger companies must share their fibre cables with smaller companies to create a more competitive market for ISPs. This did result in lower internet prices <span>“there are more than 550 resellers of high speed internet in Canada. These are smaller companies that lease network access from the big providers at wholesale prices then turn around and sell internet plans to consumers.”</span> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/internet-services-rates-canada-1.4596554" class="source inline">(Saltzman, 2018).</a> Creating a system which allows Canadians to access cheaper internet is progress, <span class="highlight">however the system we rely on should not be charging us so excessively that they can lease their infrastructure to other companies who are then still capable of charging us less.</span> Additionally, the bill which allowed smaller providers to access fibre cables was amended to add requirements for smaller companies to lease these cables. These requirements are so costly that it has become difficult for ISP competition to survive once again. <span>“In 2015, the CRTC mandated that Canada's major players also had to share their highest-speed fibre optic networks with their smaller competitors. But Stein says the way the rules are written, the smaller providers still can't gain access, leaving the big players to dominate the fibre market.”</span> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/internet-telcos-fibre-optic-high-speed-1.4894764" class="source">(Harris, 2018)</a></p>
                <p>When mandated to charge small companies less for leasing cables large ISP companies use the monetary power they have over the internet in Canada as leverage to continue to charge high prices. This demonstrates the major issue with only having 3 major ISPs in Canada. <span class="quote">“Bell Canada says it will cut roughly 200,000 households from a rural internet expansion program after a federal regulator lowered wholesale broadband prices that major telecom companies can charge smaller internet providers.”</span> </p>
                <p>John Lawford, executive director and general counsel of the Public Interest Advocacy Centre said <span>"It seems like they're trying to put the blame on not being able to charge the excessively high prices that they had been… If Bell was counting on charging too high a price for these services to wholesale ISPs as a way to fund rural broadband, that doesn't make a lot of sense."</span> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/bell-canada-internet-1.5252419" class="source inline">(Bickis, 2019).</a></p>

                <h2  id="3">What Needs to Be Done</h2>
                <p class="highlight">The internet should exist to serve the public. </p>
                <p>We must consult and work with Indigenous communities throughout the process of establishing the internet in Canada. If we choose to address lack of coverage through funding, funding needs to have structure built in to prioritize Indigenous communities in a way that works with them. This is vital as a form of respect but also considering that the internet as Denise Williams, CEO of the First Nations Technology Council says <span>“Spectrum allocation — the airwaves — is a natural resource… and it’s really important to consider Indigenous Peoples’ right to spectrum in this country. And their right to build telecommunications companies, infrastructure and policies as a result of having access to that spectrum.”</span> <a target="_blank" href="https://thetyee.ca/News/2019/12/12/Closing-BC-Indigenous-Internet-Gap/" class="source inline">(Hyslop, 2019). </a></p>
                <p><span>The Connecting Families program needs to be extended to cover more than just families.</span> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/111.nsf/eng/home" class="source inline">(Innovation Canada, 2019).</a> This is a program which current allows <span>“eligible Canadian families to access high speed Internet service packages for $10 per month from participating Internet Service Providers.”</span> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/barriers-to-digital-equity-acorn-canada-report-low-income-families-1.5244339" class="source inline">(Draaisma, 2019).</a> It is not simply families who need the internet and face barriers to accessing it. We must expand this program to cover all low income individuals specifically students, seniors, and individuals facing financial barriers. </p>
                <p>We must impose caps on the costs of the internet, as well as impose regulation against pricing internet differently geographically.</p>
                <p class="highlight">What can you do? <a target="_blank" href="https://applications.crtc.gc.ca/question/eng/public-inquiries-form?t=32&_ga=2.256689289.342669778.1587319844-1502577448.1586727451">Contact the CRTC</a></p>

                <h3 id="3.1">Letter Template</h3>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
                    <p>I am writing regarding the broadband internet fund and the current measures put in place to ensure that Canadians have access to the internet they need. Given how vital the internet has become in our daily lives connecting us, allowing us to learn, and have access to vital information I believe that the internet should be a right, and that everyone should have access to it. While I think that the broadband internet fund has resulted in some amazing projects I do not believe that it is sufficient in scope or scale. </p>
                    <p>I believe the internet is a right and therefore we should work towards purchasing the fibre cables from the private companies that own them. The internet is a natural resource and should be publicly owned. This would allow the internet to become a public service with more affordable rates similar to a utilities bill. Since this is a sufficient task, which would take a large amount of funding for the time being, amendments must be made to the broadband fund. </p>
                    <p> Seeing as those with the worst internet currently are living in Indigenous communities I believe that the CRTC has a responsibility to work with Indigenous communities to address their needs. The Broadband Fund does not address these communities specifically, and therefore they will continue to be underserved. We must establish a system which includes indignenous communities in the development of internet connection in Canada along the way, not as an afterthought. </p>
                    <p>Work with the federal government to expand the connecting families program to provide affordable internet for low income individuals as well as families.</p>
                    <p>Thank you for your time. I strongly urge you to consider working with the Canadians and residents of Canada to address their needs fairly to ensure a better overall society in Canada.</p>
                    <p>Regards,</p>
